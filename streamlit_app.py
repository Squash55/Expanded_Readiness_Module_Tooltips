st.markdown("""
**Problem Context:**  
Several U.S. and allied Air Force bases show a range of challenges in mission complexity, logistics readiness, and equipment availability.  
Notably, multiple bases present high maintenance burdens and personnel gaps, signaling a need for targeted interventions.

**Detected Issues:**  
- High mission complexity often aligns with low cyber resilience and flight ops readiness  
- Equipment availability below 60 correlates with poor logistics readiness and medical scores  
- Bases in remote areas tend to have higher fuel supply issues and training gaps

**Impact:**  
These patterns reduce operational flexibility and threaten mission success in time-sensitive scenarios. Delayed logistics or medical support can severely degrade deployment readiness.

**Potential Solutions:**  
- üì¶ Deploy mobile logistics teams to bases with low logistics and fuel scores  
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Launch remote or AI-enabled training modules for undertrained personnel  
- üõ†Ô∏è Create a predictive maintenance model to address high maintenance burden bases  
- üß¨ Use AI to identify bases with latent risk combinations (e.g., high complexity + low cyber + high personnel gaps)  
- üõ∞Ô∏è Improve data-driven prioritization of resource allocation across regions

**Next Steps:**  
This dashboard should feed into a command-level readiness review and support continuous improvement initiatives using AI-CII principles.
