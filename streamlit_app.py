st.subheader("üß† Adaptive Problem Statement (AI-Assisted)")

st.markdown("""
**Problem Context:**  
Several U.S. and allied Air Force bases show challenges in mission complexity, logistics readiness, and equipment availability.  
Many exhibit high maintenance burdens and personnel gaps, suggesting urgent needs.

**Detected Patterns:**  
- High mission complexity often aligns with low cyber resilience and flight ops readiness  
- Equipment availability below 60 often co-occurs with poor logistics and medical scores  
- Bases in remote areas show higher fuel supply risks and training gaps

**Potential Solutions:**  
- üì¶ Deploy mobile logistics support to underperforming areas  
- üß† Use AI-enabled training tools for low-proficiency bases  
- üõ† Create predictive maintenance dashboards  
- üìç Prioritize bases with complex mission + high personnel gaps + low cyber resilience

**Next Steps:**  
Feed these insights into an AI-CII powered readiness review with optimization interventions.
